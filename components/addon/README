ADD-ON README
-------------

The HHLS client add-on is used to provide implementations for special devices for toggled channel clients (ie. instead of just making the screen flash, it can control a USB outlet or something similar). Also, it can be used to run executables on the client computer.

To add your own devices, see the devices.jsm file. You can use Firefox APIs and XPCOM interfaces to control the device, or call external processes (through the nsIProcess XPCOM interface).

To modify the functions that are made available to the HHLS client webpage, see the commands.jsm file.
