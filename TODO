TODO

 - clientframe:
    - client FF add-on (detection and device list)
 - clientframe2:
    - client FF add-on (forwarding of "ext_device" from URL into JavaScript on server; client prompting for custom command line execs for "on" and "off" commands if selected (and prefs in "options") ... and change the "Change Channel" button to "Change Channel or Device" if we're using a device)
    - automatic lighting based on sound for timed channels
    - show in "loaded sounds" only when audio is loaded
 - /client/addon (zipfile generation) and link to it in /client or on home page (probably not /client/frame, cause then it would almost be a per-frame thing)

 - control:
    - NEXT/PREV FOR VIDEOS


 - Camera Viewer:
    - Add option (in "options") for a time delay for the camera (like "20 seconds" or something) to delay the video (so we can have a camera on the people as they enter somewhere, and show it later)
    - Onclick on the actual video should be play/pause, and if we do this also have a "back to live feed" button - maybe a "play" arrow with a vertical line on the right... >|

Alternatives to the HTML5/WebRTC camera system:
 - http://goalbit.sourceforge.net/ (Windows-only)
 - VLC streaming
