TODO

 - control:
    - Test everything - a lot! Sequences, effects, keyboard shortcuts, all edge cases, ...

 - client2:
    - Implement FS/PointerLock so it's easy to go full screen and if pointer lock is enabled then screensaver/low power mode (screen dimming) SHOULDN'T happen (TODO: test this)

 - clientframe2:
    - automatic lighting based on sound for timed channels
    - show in "loaded sounds" only when audio is loaded
    - Implement device/controller stuff... Show a small icon on the page if it is being used with a controller or device (mouseover shows more info about the controller/device)

 - components/addon
    - device detection and interaction
    - add a system to write executables to a pref so they stay between restarts

 - /client/addon.xpi (zipfile generation)
    - fix issues (FF says its "corrupted" - maybe examine it in 7-zip?)
    - link to it in /client or on home page (probably not /client/frame, cause then it would look like a per-frame thing)

 - Camera Viewer:
    - Add option (in "options") for a time delay for the camera (like "20 seconds" or something) to delay the video (so we can have a camera on the people as they enter somewhere, and show it later)
    - Onclick on the actual video should be play/pause, and if we do this also have a "back to live feed" button - maybe a "play" arrow with a vertical line on the right... >|

Alternatives to the HTML5/WebRTC camera system:
 - http://goalbit.sourceforge.net/ (Windows-only)
 - VLC streaming
