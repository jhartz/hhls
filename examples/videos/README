This directory contains video files that can be played in the video player.
The directory name can be changed in config.js


If you include one video (same basename) in multiple formats (different extensions), the video player will automatically figure out which one to use based on the computer's compatibility.
Example: movie.webm, movie.mp4, movie.ogv
(They're all the same video, but just in different formats; the video player now has a choice in case it is not compatible with one of the formats.)


You can include cues in the video (almost like subtitles only visible to the control, not to the full-screen video playing to the audience) by writing them in a WebVTT file called basename.vtt where basename is the name of the video (without the extension).


You can run effects at specific times in the video by including details in a JSON file called basename.json where basename is the name of the video (without the extension). This follows a very similar format to the way keyboard shortcuts and sequences are stored.

Format for the JSON file:

    [
        {
            "time": TIME,
            "command": "COMMAND",
            "data": DATA
        }, ...
    ]

TIME is a JavaScript number (float) representing a point in the video (in seconds)

COMMAND is one of the commands that can be processed by the controlcmd function in control.js
Some useful ones are:
    pause     (pauses the video)
    effect    (plays an effect)

DATA specifies more info if COMMAND requires it (like "effect"):
    "command": "effect",
    "data": {
        "channel": "...",
        "preset": "..."
    }

    "command": "effect",
    "data": {
        "channel": "...",
        "light": [1,2,3,4],
        "sound": "..."
    }
