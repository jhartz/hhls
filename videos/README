This directory contains video files that can be played in the video player.

If you include one video (same basename) in multiple formats (different extensions), the client will automatically figure out which one to use based on the client computer's compatibility.
Example: movie.webm, movie.mp4, movie.ogv
(Tthey're all the same video, but just in different formats; the client now has a choice in case it is not compatible with one of the formats.)

The directory name can be configured in config.js
